# ender-3-v2-sprite-crtouch-klipper
Klipper printer.cfg for Creality Ender 3 v2 CR Touch Sprite (work in progress)

Note: these are not HOW TO steps for setting up Klipper, only working files from my config and some reference info.

I am making this file available as I am setting up my first Klipper printer, as finding a good working printer.cfg file is proving not that easy.

Also the klipper.bin  file is for the SD card to flash to the printer (turn printer off, unplug native display, unplug usb cable, insert SD card, turn on, wait a few seconds, connect usb cable from your pi running Klipper Mainsail OS)
